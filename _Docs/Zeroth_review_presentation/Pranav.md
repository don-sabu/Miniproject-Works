**Objectives**

    1. Automated Data Extraction: Develop a system to automatically extract marks written by teachers on answer sheets, eliminating the need for manual data entry.

    2. Enhanced Efficiency for Teachers: Reduce the time and effort required for teachers to input marks into digital systems by providing a streamlined and automated solution.

    3. Customizable Model: Create a custom machine learning model tailored to recognize marks in various formats and handwriting styles, enhancing adaptability.

    4. Integration with Existing Systems: Since the output is in CSV format, it enables seamless integration with existing educational software or databases.

    5. Scalability: Develop a solution that can scale to handle large volumes of answer sheets efficiently, accommodating the needs of educational institutions with varying numbers of students.

**Data Description**

    1. Data Type: The data primarily consists of handwritten marks written by teachers on answer sheets.

    2. Variability: The handwriting styles may vary significantly among different teachers, requiring robust preprocessing techniques for accurate data extraction.

    3. Layout: The marks are organized in a structured layout, aligned in rows and columns corresponding to different questions or sections of the answer sheet.

    4. Dataset Size: The dataset comprises enough samples to train and validate the custom model effectively, ensuring robust performance across different writing styles.
