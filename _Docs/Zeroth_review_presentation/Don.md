### How are we gonna achieve the objectives?


1.
    - Show the previous system's block diagram from the report
    - Show key features of that point which we are adopting

2.
    - What are the changes we are making?
      - How we are detecting the cells with half mark
      - Showing the detected marks as a table as soon as the image is captured, making teachers easy to evaluate whether marks are detected correctly and make any changes.
      - Inform if model has low confidence about a particular cell instead of predicting wrongly.
